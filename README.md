CAS 1.0 and 2.0 compliant CAS server module for simpleSAMLphp

This is the simpleSAMLphp CAS server module developed at the State and University Library in Aarhus Denmark.
The module is a fork of an old version of the CAS module shipped with simpleSAMLphp which has undergone a couple of
iterations of refactoring, bugfixes and enhancements. For details see the ChangeLog in the doc directory.

All files are rewritten based on work by Dubravko Voncina. See Google Groups discussion in this thread:
